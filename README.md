# Recommendation-System

In this project , I have analysed interactions that users have on IBM Watson Studio platform , and made recommendations to them about new articles they will like. After carrying out exploratory data analysis, I used techniques like Rank Based recommendation, User-User Based Collaborative filtering method and Matrix Factorization with SVD.
I thank IBM and Udacity for providing the dataset.
